/*Yes, the given pseudo-code is a good outline for a password generator. However, 
there are a couple of things that can be improved:

Instead of using a break statement to handle invalid input for the password length, 
it would be better to use a while loop to repeatedly prompt the user until valid input is entered.

To check whether at least one of the character types (lowercase, uppercase, numeric, special characters) 
has been selected, you can use a variable (e.g. has_selected) and set it to false initially. Then, for each type that is selected, 
set has_selected to true. At the end of the character type selection, check if has_selected is still false. If it is, prompt the user 
to select at least one type again.

It would be better to use a library function to generate a random number, rather than Math.random()
